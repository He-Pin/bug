# Welcome to the Scala 2 tracker!

## What belongs here?

This is the right place to report a bug or a minor shortcoming in the Scala 2 compiler, standard library, and language specification.

To keep this tracker focused, we ask that feature requests and discussion of potential language changes take place in the [language design](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/c/language-design) category on our contributors forum.

For further bug reporting guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/scala/bug/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
